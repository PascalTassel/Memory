# Memory game
My first achievement with node.js, have fun !

## Note
Working with **npm 6.14.8 and node v12.18.4**.

## Description ##

* Game written in Node.js, HTML5 and CSS3.
* Primary Author:
    Pascal Tassel
    
*This assumes an elementary knowledge of node.js and how npm works with the package.json file* (basically what the "dependencies" are and how the "scripts" are called when the npm command is run in the same directory). It also assumes that node, npm, and git are installed.

The build files used are pretty simple, and are also documented well. In order to run the project follow the steps below. *First make sure node and npm are installed and up to date*
    
    1.  **git clone** https://github.com/PascalTassel/Memory.git
    1.  **cd** memory
    1.  **npm install**
    1.  **npm start**
    1.  *Browse to localhost:3000*

## Settings
Edit **src/index.js" for game settings.
